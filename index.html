<h1>Wiseman
  
<h2>By Frank Ocean</h2>
  

  
 <p>Wiseman closes mouth<br>
Madman closes fist<br>
Young man shows his age,<br>
Judge man named it sin<br>
Bad man don't exist, no<br>
No evil man exists<br>
Good man don't exist, no<br>
No righteous man exists<br>
Sad man cannot cry<br>
In place where man can see<br>
Never witnessed father weep<br>
This old man thought it weak<br>
But strong man don't exist<br>
No undying man exists<br>
Weak man don't exist, no<br>
Just flesh and blood exists</p>
